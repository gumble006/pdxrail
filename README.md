# PDX Rail

PDX Rail is a project designed for users to interactively map Portland's fixed transit rail lines and stations.  This application was built using the React and Leaflet, and uses a `Map` component to share DOM updates between the two.  

## Set Up

`npm install`

`npm run dev` and visit localhost:8080 in your browser

The project uses static geoJSON, but could easily be set up to access additional geospatial data.
